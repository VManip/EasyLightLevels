This mod was made with the Vintage Story Visual Studio template mod. To use it yourself, download it from the wiki on [this page](https://wiki.vintagestory.at/index.php?title=Modding:Setting_up_your_Development_Environment), run the modtools setup, add a dll mod with id "easylightlevels", and place this repo in mods-dll/easylightlevels/ (... I believe. There might be more to it, but this seemed to work).
