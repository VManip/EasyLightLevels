# EasyLightLevels
A Vintage Story mod that allows you to easily see the light levels of blocks around you.

This mod was made with the Vintage Story Visual Studio template mod. To use it yourself, download it from the wiki on [this page](https://wiki.vintagestory.at/index.php?title=Modding:Setting_up_your_Development_Environment), run the modtools setup, add a dll mod with id "easylightlevels", and place this repo in mods-dll/easylightlevels/ (... I believe. There might be more to it, but this seemed to work).

### Changelog

- **Removed** support for configuring lighting rules via the config file.
- **Added** `F7` as the default hotkey to toggle light levels.
- **Added** a color-aid mode:  
  Use `.lightlvl colorAid` or `lightlvl ca` to enable it.
- **Updated** behavior so that blocks with a high light level will no longer be highlighted.
- **Changed** the default radius to `32`.

### Motive

Since **ElPatron** is unable to distinguish green from red, he wasnâ€™t able to benefit from this mod.  
I wanted to make it more accessible for him by adding a **color-aid mode**.

While I was at it, I also **refactored** and **reworked** the mod a bit.
